# Marketing Analytics Lecture Notes {-}

These notes accompany **MKT 4320 Marketing Analytics** and are designed to support
in-class lectures, demonstrations, and discussion using **R** and **RStudio**.

The focus of these notes is on understanding *why* we use particular analytical
tools and *how* to interpret results, rather than on memorizing syntax.
